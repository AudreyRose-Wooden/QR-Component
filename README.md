## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The QR Code Component is my first Frontend Mentor Project. Other than the color codes provided in the Style Guide, I had to approximate shapes, positions, padding, etc. I tried to keep this project simple and only use HTML and CSS so I could focus on translating design to code.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to try to incorporate FlexBox and Styled Components. Otherwise, I just want to continue working on being more comfortable with styling based off of someone else's design.
